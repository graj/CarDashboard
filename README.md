============


Base Idea: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmz1V-RlBWA

- Connect iPad via Bluetooth to original Radio
- Connect iPad via (?????) to Arduino to receiv signals from Car:
- - Ultrasonic sensors for parking assist system
- - - show distance to objects in App
- - display signal from x monitoring cams around the car
- - Maybe implement a parking mode with both (ultrasonic and cams)
- - Brightness sensors for automatic nightmode


- Settings (in splitviewcontroller):
- - Enable Autonightmode (or manual)
